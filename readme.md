# ARCHIVE:0

**ARCHIVE:0** is a series of **interactive, time-reactive posters** built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), using a single custom GLSL shader to explore the aesthetics of fragmented digital memory.

Each visual behaves like a **fragmented signal**â€”glitching, fading, and layered with soft noiseâ€”as if retrieved from a synthetic archive: corrupted logs, lost memories, or failed reconstructions from a machine attempting to remember.

Inspired by Mike Lemanskiâ€™s *Twilight Zone* posters, this project reimagines static graphic design as a **dynamic, generative experience**, using code to express organic imperfection in digital form.
